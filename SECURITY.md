# Security Policy

- Report vulnerabilities to: security@aibradaa.example (triage within 24h).
- Supported versions: main branch; security fixes backported as needed.
- No plaintext secrets in repo (see .config/.env.example). Use CI secrets for deploy.
- Incident readiness: follow governance/playbooks; declare severity; rollback-first posture.
