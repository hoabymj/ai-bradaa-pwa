# ADR-001: Adopt /pwa as Source-of-Truth for Manifest and Service Worker

- Context: Multiple placements caused drift.
- Decision: Place manifest.json and service-worker.js under /pwa; link and register from there; keep root fallback only.
- Consequences: Clear portability; installability stable.
- Rollback: Revert to root paths and update links.
